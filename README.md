# Project 1 for CS3500, October 2022

This project was to use model-view-controller architecture to recreate the game marble solitaire/peg solitaire. We did this in multiple parts: first making the model and a text view, then adding a controller, then adding new types of boards, then finally making a GUI view. This project highlighted the benefits of MVC architecture and taught me lots about designing a large program with many classes and moving parts.
